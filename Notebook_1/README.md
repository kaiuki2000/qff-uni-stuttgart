# Notebook 1 — Qiskit 101 Practice

This notebook serves as an introduction to Qiskit and provides hands-on practice with the core concepts covered in the **Qiskit 101 session** on Monday, November 3, 2025.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Provide participants with practical experience in building and running simple quantum circuits.  
- Reinforce foundational concepts from the Qiskit 101 lecture: qubits, gates, measurement, basic algorithms, and the difference between simulators and real hardware.

---

## 📘 Contents
- `prompt_1.ipynb` — the interactive notebook with guided exercises and examples.

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
- Create and visualize basic quantum circuits.  
- Apply single- and two-qubit gates (X, H, CNOT, etc.).  
- Run circuits on a statevector simulator and interpret the results.  
- Use basic transpilation and understand measurement noise vs. ideal simulation.  

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ (3.10 recommended)  
- Qiskit (latest stable release)  
- `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and either Jupyter/JupyterLab or VS Code Notebook support
