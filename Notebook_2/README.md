# 🏴‍☠️ Notebook 2 — *The Call from the Caribbean*

Welcome, traveler of the quantum seas!  
This second notebook continues your adventure, blending the legendary **Elitzur–Vaidman interaction-free measurement** with a playful, pirate-inspired twist — where photons become explorers, and treasure chests may conceal perilous parchment traps.

---

## 🧭 Overview

Your mission is to **design and simulate quantum circuits** (or interferometer setups) that allow the detection of parchment hidden in trapped chests — **without triggering their destruction**.  

As the challenge unfolds, you’ll:
- Recreate and analyze a quantum version of the “bomb tester” using Qiskit.  
- Extend it to **multiple chests**, seeking strategies that maximize efficiency and information gain.  
- Explore creative trade-offs between accuracy, resource cost, and risk.  

The notebook is fully self-guided — each section introduces the story, physics, and coding tasks you’ll need.  
But if you ever find yourself adrift, look for the **hidden dropdown hints** scattered throughout the notebook.  
They’ll help steer your ship back on course.  

*(And if even that fails, reach out to the organizers or helpers — we’re always nearby on Discord or during the hackathon.)*

## ⚙️ Repository Files

- `prompt_2.ipynb` — the interactive challenge notebook and instructions.  
- `images/` — supporting figures and illustrations used in the notebook.  
- `README.md` — this file, providing setup and participation details.  
- `BasQQiskit_Fall-Fest_2025_Slides.pdf` — our prompt was **heavily inspired** by this example!  
  We think the notebook alone gives you everything you need, but if you’d like some extra inspiration, this reference is worth a look.

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Make sure your Python environment has **Qiskit** and its dependencies installed.  
   (See the main `README.md` for environment setup instructions.)  
2. Open the notebook `prompt_2.ipynb`
3. Run the cells in order.  
You’ll find several **empty cells** marked for your own solutions — these are where your code and creativity come in!

## 🏆 Assessment & Submission

To complete this challenge, please submit:
- The **filled-in Jupyter notebook** (`prompt_2.ipynb`) with your solutions.  
- A short **slide deck (3–4 slides)** summarizing your reasoning and results for each of the two challenges.  

Your slides don’t need to be overly detailed — just enough to give us a clear picture of your thought process.  
Winning teams will also have the chance to **present their approach** briefly to the audience, so keep those slides handy!
