## Repository Overview

This repository contains materials for the Qiskit Fall Fest 2025 workshops and challenges, including:

* `Notebook_1/prompt_1.ipynb` ‚Äî Introduction to Qiskit 101; exercises for building, running, and measuring quantum circuits.
* `Notebook_2/prompt_2.ipynb` ‚Äî Pirate-themed intermediate challenge inspired by the Elitzur‚ÄìVaidman interaction-free measurement. Participants detect ‚Äútrapped‚Äù treasure chests without opening them.
* `Notebook_2/images/` ‚Äî Supporting figures used in the notebooks.
* `README.md` ‚Äî Setup, usage instructions, and participation guidelines.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install prerequisites

Create a Python environment (3.8+) and install dependencies:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv qff_env

# Activate it
# Windows
qff_env\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux
source qff_env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Minimal required packages include:

* `qiskit`, `qiskit-aer`, `qiskit-ibm-runtime`
* `numpy`, `matplotlib`
* `ipykernel`, `pylatexenc`
* (Optional: `jupyterlab` for interactive notebook use)

*Tip:* Version ranges are provided in `requirements.txt` to ensure reproducibility.

### 2. Run the notebooks

Open the notebooks in JupyterLab or VS Code and run cells in order. Some cells are intentionally left blank for you to implement your solutions.

### 3. Submission & Assessment

Participants should submit:

* Completed notebook(s) with code and explanations.
* 3‚Äì4 slides summarizing reasoning for each challenge (for the pirate-themed Notebook 2).

The top solution(s) will be invited to give a brief pitch during the award ceremony.
